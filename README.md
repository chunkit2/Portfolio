# Portfolio

This project is my responsive portfolio. I made this project to show my bio alongside some of the early work I have done with html,css,and javascript. I wanted to capture the change of my current field with the new one I am pursuing. Through this project I learned how to use bootstrap and more in depth css styling. Some problems I experienced were trying to align the grid, fixing broken url links, and keeping the code clean. I aligned the grid by added a code to css to make the photo fit the grid 100%, that way when it goes onto a smaller screen it automatically adjust the size. The broken links were unnoticed typo on my end when I forgot to add http://. Bootstrap is an extremely helpful tool, but it did have excess amounts of code that were not required for the page. Through trial and error, I went and elimated the not needed codes. I hope for this project to show the start of my coding journey.
